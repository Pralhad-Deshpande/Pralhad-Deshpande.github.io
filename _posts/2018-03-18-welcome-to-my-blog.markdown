This blog documents the wonderful concepts that I have leared as I explore my interest in `crypto-economics`. Although technical concepts such as `authenticated BFT` and `transaction privacy` will be discussed at great length, this is by no means a purely technical blog. Blog posts may take a historical perspective and dive into the evolution of `money` and explore how crypto-economics fits into that space. Blog posts may also study popular present day `payment systems` and explore the arguments for `fiat digital currencies`.
