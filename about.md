Hi there! I am Pralhad and I am a Research Staff Member at IBM Research since 2012. I work at the IBM Center for Blockchain Innovation (ICBI), in Singapore. I am primarily involved in the design and development Blockchain protocols for various solutions. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2012 from Stony Brook University. My dissertation research was aimed at developing wireless networking protocols for vehicular networks. This involved extensive protocol design, development and real world experimentation.
